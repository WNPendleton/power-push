# power-push
This game was created as a project for [Global Game Jam 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/power-push-4)
The theme for the game jam was "roots"

In this game, the player must defend against an endless bombardment of shapes. Squares can be defeated by typing their square root; cubes, their cube root;
and tesseracts, their fourth root.

Executable exported builds for Windows, OSX, and Linuk can be found in the 'builds' folder.
